# CODETECH-IT--PUSH-BUTTON-COUNTER-TASK-01

NAME :  G.P.SURYA DHARSHINI

COMPANY : CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

INTERN ID : CT08SHE

DOMAIN : EMBEDDED SYSTEMS

DURATION : FEBRUARY 5th, 2025 to MARCH 5th, 2025 (4 WEEKS)

MENTOR : NEELA SANTHOSH

OVERVIEW : PUSH-BUTTON-COUNTER

***Objective:***
To design a button press counter using an Arduino UNO, I2C LCD display. The system increments the count each time the button is pressed and displays it on the LCD

Key Elements:
Push Button Input – Detects button presses to increase the counter.
Debounce Mechanism – Ensures accurate button press detection.
LCD Display (I2C) – Displays the count value dynamically.
Arduino UNO – Controls the logic and processes button inputs.


Technology Used:
Arduino UNO – Microcontroller for processing inputs and outputs.
C++ (Arduino IDE) – Programming language for coding the microcontroller.
LiquidCrystal_I2C Library – For interfacing the I2C LCD display.
Digital Input/Output – Button and LED control using Arduino’s GPIO pins.
